<h3>In Short</h3>

<h4>What is SVM</h4>

<p>A support vector machine constructs a <strong>hyperplane or set of hyperplanes in a high- or infinite-dimensional space</strong>, 
which can be used for classification, regression, or other tasks.</p>

<h4>Why is SVM</h4>

<p>Original classification problem may be stated in a finite dimensional space, it often happens that 
the sets to discriminate are not linearly separable in that space. For this reason, it was proposed 
that the original finite-dimensional space be mapped into a much higher-dimensional space, presumably
making the separation easier in that space.</p>

<p>The mappings used by SVM schemes are designed to ensure that dot products may be computed easily in 
terms of the variables in the original space, by defining them in terms of a kernel function \(k(x,y)\) 
selected to suit the problem.</p>

<h4>What is optimal</h4>

<p>A good separation is achieved by the hyperplane that has the largest distance to the nearest training 
data point of any class (so-called functional margin), since in general the larger the margin the lower 
the generalization error of the classifier.</p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='motivation'>
<h3>Motivation</h3>

<p>In the case of support vector machines, a data point is viewed as a p-dimensional vector (a list of 
p numbers), and we want to know whether we can separate such points with a (p − 1)-dimensional 
hyperplane. This is called a linear classifier. </p>

<p>There are many hyperplanes that might classify the data. One reasonable choice as the best hyperplane 
is the one that represents the largest separation, or margin, between the two classes. So we choose 
the hyperplane so that the distance from it to the nearest data point on each side is maximized. If 
such a hyperplane exists, it is known as the maximum-margin hyperplane and the linear classifier it 
defines is known as a maximum margin classifier; or equivalently, the perception of optimal stability.</p>

<p>Any hyperplane can be written as the set of points \(\mathbf{x}\) satisfying</p>

<p>\(\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x} - b = 0\)</p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='more-about-svm'>
<h3>More about SVM</h3>

<p>An SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space, mapped so that the examples of
the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible. New examples are 
then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the 
gap they fall on.</p>

<p>It often happens that the sets to discriminate are not linearly separable in that space. For this 
reason, it was proposed that the original finite-dimensional space be mapped into a much 
higher-dimensional space, presumably making the separation easier in that space.</p>

<p>The hyperplanes in the higher-dimensional space are defined as the set of points whose dot product
with a vector in that space is constant.</p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='some-facts-of-geometry'>
<h3>Some Facts of Geometry</h3>

<h4>Distance from point to a plane</h4>

<p>First of all, we have to recall that one plane in Euclidean Space can be expressed as:
\[
\omega^Tx + b = 0, \;\;\;\; x \in R^d
\]
Here \(\omega\) is the <strong>normal</strong> of the hyperplane. For any point \(x_i\) that is on this hyperplane, 
it should have \(\omega^Tx_i + b = 0\).</p>

<p>Then a common question is how to calculate the distance from a point outside of plane to this hyperplane.
Suppose the point is \(x_0 \in R^d\), and we also can randomly find another point \(x_1 \in R^d\) that is on the 
hyperplane. Then we have a vector \(x_0 - x_1\), and the distance between \(x_0\) and the plane is nothing but
the norm of the projection of vector \(x_0 - x_1\) to the <strong>normal</strong> of the plane (\(\omega\)). And we know that
the projection is just the inner product of two vectors.
\[
Dist = \|\text{Proj}_{\omega}(x_0 - x_1)\| = \frac{\|\omega^T(x_0 - x_1)\|}{\|\omega\|} = \frac{\|\omega^Tx_0 + b\|}{\|\omega\|}
\]</p>

<h4>Inner product</h4>

<p>Inner product is one of the most important concept in the Geometry. We know that we define the inner product as:
\[
x \cdot y = x^Ty = \sum_{i=1}^d x_iy_i
\]
This can be also expressed as:
\[
x \cdot y = \text{Proj}_{y}(x) \|y\| = \text{Proj}_{x}(y) \|x\|
\]
Here \(\text{Proj}_{y}(x)\) means the <strong>projection of x vector on y vector</strong>. In the previous session, we have already seen
that the distance from a point to a hyperplane can be illustrated as a inner product between the normal vector \(\omega\)
and the point itself plus a constant scale \(b\). Here is one of <strong>important insight about SVM</strong> is that:</p>

<ul>
<li>If a point is very close to a hyperplane, the projection of the point to the normal vector should be very small</li>
<li>however, if a point is far away from the hyperplane, then the projection of the point to the normal should be very large.</li>
</ul>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='functional-and-geometric-margins'>
<h3>Functional and Geometric Margins</h3>

<p>The geometric margin is just a scaled version of the functional margin.</p>

<p>You can think the functional margin, just as a testing function that will tell you whether a particular 
point is properly classified or not. And the geometric margin is functional margin scaled by \(\|\omega\|\)</p>

<p>the result would be positive for properly classified points and negative otherwise. If you scale 
that by \(\|\omega\|\) then you will have the geometric margin. </p>

<p>Why does the geometric margin exists?</p>

<p>Well to maximize the margin you need more that just the sign, you need to have a notion of magnitude,
the functional margin would give you a number but without a reference you can&#39;t tell if the point is 
actually far away or close to the decision plane. The geometric margin is telling you not only if 
the point is properly classified or not, but the magnitude of that distance in term of units of 
\(\|\omega\|\) </p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='primal-optimization'>
<h3>Primal Optimization</h3>

<p>First of all, consider a problem of the following form:</p>

<p>\[
\begin{aligned}
\min_{\omega} & f(\omega) \\
s.t. & h_i(\omega) = 0, \;\;\; i = 1, \cdots, l 
\end{aligned}
\]</p>

<p>It is obvious that the method of Lagrange multipliers can be used to solve it. In this method, we
define the <strong>Lagrangian</strong> to be
\[
\mathcal{L}(\omega, \beta) = f(\omega) + \sum_{i=1}^{l}\beta_ih_i(\omega)
\]
Here the \(\beta\)&#39;s are called the <strong>Lagrangian multipliers</strong>. We would then find and set \(\mathcal{L}\)&#39;s
partial derivatives to zero:
\[
\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\omega_i} = 0; \;\;\; \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\beta_i} = 0
\]
and solve for \(\omega\) and \(\beta\), since the second derivative will give us \(h_i(\omega) = 0\)</p>

<p>But sometimes, the constraint are not just \(h_i(\omega) = 0\). We may have inequality and equality constraints.
So the problem will become as following, which we call the <strong>primal</strong> optimization problem:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\min_{\omega} & f(\omega) \\
s.t. & g_i(\omega) \le 0, \;\;\; i = 1, \cdots, k \\
& h_i(\omega) = 0, \;\;\; i = 1, \cdots, l 
\end{aligned}
\]
To solve it, we start by defining the <strong>generalized Lagrangian</strong>
\[
\mathcal{L}(\omega, \beta) = f(\omega) + \sum_{i=1}^{k}\alpha_ig_i(\omega) + \sum_{i=1}^{l}\beta_ih_i(\omega)
\]
Here, \(\alpha_i\) and \(\beta_i\) are Lagrange multipliers. And for the multipliers associated with inequality,
we should have further constraint: \(\alpha_i \ge 0\). Consider the quantity:
\[
\theta_{\mathcal{P}}(\omega) = \max_{\alpha, \beta: \alpha_i \ge 0} \mathcal{L}(\omega, \alpha, \beta)
\]
Here, the &quot;\(\mathcal{P}\)&quot; subscript stands for &quot;primal&quot;. For this quantity, we fix the \(\omega\), and vary 
\(\alpha\) and \(\beta\). If the given \(\omega\) violates any primal constraints for some \(i\), the we will have 
\[
\theta_{\mathcal{P}}(\omega) = f(\omega) + \max_{\alpha} \sum_{i=1}^{k}\alpha_ig_i(\omega) + \max_{\beta} 
\sum_{i=1}^{l}\beta_ih_i(\omega) =  \infty
\]
It is obvious that we can easily find \(\beta_i\)&#39;s to make \(\sum_{i=1}^{l}\beta_ih_i(\omega)\) to be \(\infty\) if
\(h_i(\omega) \ne 0\). Same for the \(\alpha_i\)&#39;s
Conversely, if the constraints are indeed satisfied for the given value of \(\omega\), then 
\(\theta_{\mathcal{P}}(\omega) = f(\omega)\). Hence,</p>

<p>\[ \theta_{\mathcal{P}}(\omega) = \left\{
  \begin{array}{l l}
    f(\omega) & \quad \text{if $\omega$ satisfies primal constraints}\\
    \infty & \quad \text{otherwise}
  \end{array} \right.\]</p>

<p>Thus, \(\theta_{\mathcal{P}}\) takes the same value as the objective in our problem for all value of \(\omega\) 
that satisfies the primal constraints, and is positive infinity if constraints are violated. So if we consider
the minimization problem:</p>

<p>\[
\min_{\omega} \theta_{\mathcal{P}}(\omega) = \min_{\omega} \max_{\alpha, \beta: \alpha_i \ge 0} \mathcal{L}(\omega, \alpha, \beta)
\]</p>

<p>will be the same problem (and has the same solutions as) our original primal problem. For later use, we define 
the optimal value of the objective to be </p>

<p>\[p^* = \min_{\omega} \theta_{\mathcal{P}}(\omega)\]</p>

<h4>Note</h4>

<p>One thing should keep in mind is that in the primal problem (primal optimization), we first maximize our objective function 
\(\mathcal{L}(\omega, \alpha, \beta)\) with respect to \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) for a given \(\omega\), because we can tell if this 
given \(\omega\) is satisfied constraints or not by checking if the maximization of \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) is infinity or not.
And then minimize over \(\omega\), this basically just identify \(f(\omega)\) from infinity.</p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='dual-optimization'>
<h3>Dual Optimization</h3>

<p>Now, besides the primal problem, let&#39;s look at a slightly different problem. We define that 
\[
\theta_{\mathcal{D}}(\alpha, \beta) = \min_{\omega}\mathcal{L}(\omega, \alpha, \beta)
\]
Here, the &quot;\(\mathcal{D}\)&quot; subscript stands for &quot;dual&quot;. Note that the difference between \(\theta_{\mathcal{D}}\) 
and \(\theta_{\mathcal{P}}\):</p>

<ul>
<li>\(\theta_{\mathcal{P}}(\omega) = \max_{\alpha, \beta} \mathcal{L}(\omega, \alpha, \beta)\), 
and then \(\min_{\omega} \theta_{\mathcal{P}}(\omega)\)</li>
<li>\(\theta_{\mathcal{D}}(\alpha, \beta) = \min_{\omega} \mathcal{L}(\omega, \alpha, \beta)\), 
and then \(\max_{\alpha, \beta} \theta_{\mathcal{D}}(\alpha, \beta)\)</li>
</ul>

<p>So the <strong>dual</strong> optimization problem is:</p>

<p>\[
\max_{\alpha, \beta: \alpha_i \ge 0} \theta_{\mathcal{D}}(\alpha, \beta) = \max_{\alpha, \beta: \alpha_i \ge 0} \min_{\omega}
\mathcal{L} (\omega, \alpha, \beta)
\]</p>

<p>This is exactly the same as our primal problem, except that the order of the &quot;max&quot; and &quot;min&quot; are now exchanged.
We also define the optimal value of dual problem&#39;s objective to be:
\[
d^* =  \max_{\alpha, \beta: \alpha_i \ge 0} \theta_{\mathcal{D}}(\alpha, \beta)
\]
Since we know the &quot;max min&quot; of a function always being less than or equal to the &quot;min max&quot;, we can have
\[
d^* = \max_{\alpha, \beta: \alpha_i \ge 0} \min_{\omega} \mathcal{L} (\omega, \alpha, \beta) \le
\min_{\omega} \max_{\alpha, \beta: \alpha_i \ge 0} \mathcal{L}(\omega, \alpha, \beta) = p^*
\]
However under certain conditions, we will have \(d^* = p^*\). So that we can solve the dual problem in lieu of the primal problem.</p>

<p>Assumption:</p>

<ul>
<li>\(f\) and \(g_i\)&#39;s are convex</li>
<li>\(h_i\)&#39;s are affine, which means there exists \(a_i\) and \(b_i\) so that \(h_i(\omega) = a_i^T\omega + b_i\). Affine means the same
thing as linear, except that we also allow the extra intercept term \(b_i\)</li>
<li>constraints \(g_i\) are strictly feasible, which means there exists some \(\omega\) so that \(g_i(\omega) < 0\) for all \(i\).</li>
</ul>

<p>Under these three assumptions, there <strong>must</strong> exist \(\omega^*, \alpha^*, \beta^*\) so that \(\omega^*\) is the solution to the 
primal problem, \(\alpha^*, \beta^*\) are the solution to the dual problem, and moreover, \(p^* = d^* = \mathcal{L}(\omega^*, \alpha^*, \beta^*)\).
Moreover, \(\omega^*, \alpha^*, \beta^*\) satisfy the <strong>Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions</strong>, which are as follows:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial}{\partial \omega_i}\mathcal{L}(\omega^*, \alpha^*, \beta^*) = 0 \;\;\; i = 1, \cdots, d \\
\frac{\partial}{\partial \beta_i}\mathcal{L}(\omega^*, \alpha^*, \beta^*) = 0 \;\;\; i = 1, \cdots, l \\
\alpha_i^*g_i(\omega^*) = 0 \;\;\; i = 1, \cdots, k \\
g_i(\omega^*) \le 0 \;\;\; i = 1, \cdots, k \\
\alpha_i^* \ge 0 \;\;\; i = 1, \cdots, k 
\end{aligned}
\]
Also, we have:
\[
\omega^*, \alpha^*, \beta^* \text{are the solution to the dual and primal problem correspondingly} \\
\iff \omega^*, \alpha^*, \beta^* \text{satisfy the KKT conditions}
\]</p>

<p>We should draw attention to the third condition, <strong>\(\alpha_i^*g_i(\omega^*) = 0\)</strong>, which is called the 
<strong>KKT dual complementarity</strong> condition. Specifically, it implies that if \(\alpha_i^* > 0\), then \(g_i(\omega^*) = 0\).</p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='optimal-margin-classifiers'>
<h3>Optimal Margin Classifiers</h3>

<p>Previous in the session of functional and geometric margin, we posed the following primal optimization problem for 
finding the optimal margin classifier:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\min_{\gamma, \omega, b} & \frac{1}{2} \|\omega\|^2 \\
s.t. & y_i(\omega^Tx_i + b) \ge 1, \;\;\; i = 1, \cdots, m 
\end{aligned}
\]
Because in generalized Lagrangian we always have \(\le\) inequality, we can write the constraints as:
\[
g_i(\omega) = - y_i(\omega^Tx_i + b) + 1 \le 0
\]
We have one such constraint for each training example. Note that from the KKT dual complementarity condition, we will 
have \(\alpha_i > 0\) only for the training examples that have functional margin exactly equal to 1. Those points are
called the <strong>support vectors</strong></p>

<p>Now we construct the Lagrangian for our optimization problem:
\[
\mathcal{L}(\omega, b, \alpha) = \frac{1}{2}\|\omega\|^2 - \sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_i[y_i(\omega^Tx_i + b) - 1]
\]
Let&#39;s find the dual form first.</p>

<h4>Why dual form not primal form</h4>

<p>dual and primal problems are two different ways to solve the optimization problem right above. If we try the primal
form first, then we have to try to find out the \(\theta_{\mathcal{P}}(\omega)\) which is the maximum of \(\mathcal{L}\) over 
\(\alpha\) for a given \(\omega\).
It is easy to find that this maximization cannot be solved by taking the derivative with respect to \(\alpha\)</p>

<p>Then we are thinking if we can solve the dual form under specific conditions, then the solution to dual form will also be
the solution to the primal problem. So that is why we are considering the dual form now.</p>

<h4>Dual form to primal form</h4>

<p>We need to minimize \(\mathcal{L}(\omega, b, \alpha)\) with respect to \(\omega\) and \(b\)
for fixed \(\alpha\) to get \(\theta_{\mathcal{D}}\). So we can have:
\[
\bigtriangledown_{\omega} \mathcal{L}(\omega, b, \alpha) = \omega - \sum_{i=1}^m\alpha_iy_ix_i = 0
\]
This implies that 
\[
\omega = \sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_iy_ix_i
\]
As for the derivative with respect to \(b\), we obtain
\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial b} \mathcal{L}(\omega, b, \alpha) = \sum_{i=1}^m\alpha_iy_i = 0
\]</p>

<p>If we take the definition of \(\omega =\sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_iy_ix_i\) and plug that back into the \(\mathcal{L}\),
also replace \(\sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_iy_i\) with 0. Then we have:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{L}(\omega, b, \alpha) & = \frac{1}{2}\omega^T\omega - \sum_{i=1}^m\alpha_iy_i\omega^Tx_i - 
b\sum_{i=1}^m\alpha_iy_i + \sum_{i=1}^m\alpha_i \\
& = \sum_{i=1}^m\alpha_i +\omega^T(\frac{1}{2}\omega - \sum_{i=1}^m\alpha_iy_ix_i) \\
& = \sum_{i=1}^m\alpha_i +\omega^T(\frac{1}{2}\omega - \omega) \\
& = \sum_{i=1}^m\alpha_i - \frac{1}{2}\omega^T\omega \\
& = \sum_{i=1}^m\alpha_i - \frac{1}{2}(\sum_{i=1}^m\alpha_iy_ix_i)^T(\sum_{j=1}^m\alpha_jy_jx_j) \\
& = \sum_{i=1}^m\alpha_i - \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^m \alpha_i\alpha_j y_iy_j x_i^Tx_j
\end{aligned}
\]</p>

<p>Then the next step is to maximize the \(\mathcal{L}\) in the above form. Putting this together with constraints \(\alpha_i \ge 0\)
we obtain the following dual optimization problem:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\max_{\alpha} & W(\alpha) = \sum_{i=1}^m\alpha_i - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^m \alpha_i\alpha_j y_iy_j 
\langle x_i, x_j \rangle \\
s.t. & \alpha_i \ge 0 \;\;\; i = 1, \cdots, m \\
& \sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_iy_i = 0
\end{aligned}
\]
More important, 
the conditions for \(p^* = d^*\)</p>

<ul>
<li>\(f\) and \(g_i\)&#39;s are convex</li>
<li>\(h_i\)&#39;s are affine, which means there exists \(a_i\) and \(b_i\) so that \(h_i(\omega) = a_i^T\omega + b_i\). Affine means the same
thing as linear, except that we also allow the extra intercept term \(b_i\)</li>
<li>constraints \(g_i\) are strictly feasible, which means there exists some \(\omega\) so that \(g_i(\omega) < 0\) for all \(i\).</li>
</ul>

<p>and the KKT conditions: </p>

<pre><code>(I should add more intuition here!!!)
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>No matter what \(\alpha\) we found, \(\omega = \sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_i y_i\) is the solution to 
\(\bigtriangledown_{\omega} \mathcal{L}(\omega, b, \alpha) = 0\). Same for the \(b\). This makes the first KKT condition to be valid.</li>
<li>Second KKT condition we do not have here since we do not have equality constraint. Wen only have \(\alpha\) here.</li>
<li>\(g_i(\omega) = - y_i(\omega^Tx_i + b) + 1 \le 0\) is satisfied here.</li>
<li>We have \(\alpha_i \ge 0\)</li>
<li>\(\alpha_ig_i(\omega) = 0\) is satisfied when construct the Lagrangian for our optimization problem </li>
</ul>

<p>to hold are indeed satisfied in this optimization problem. </p>

<p>Suppose we are indeed able to solve the above maximization problem with respect to \(\alpha\), then we can use 
\(\omega = \sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_i y_ix_i\) to go back and find the \(\omega^*\). Using \(\alpha^*\) and \(\omega^*\), then we solve the \(b^*\)
by 
\[
b^* = \arg\min_{b}\mathcal{L}(\omega^*, b, \alpha^*) = -\frac{\max_{i:y_i=-1}\omega^{*T}x_i + \min_{i:y_i=1}\omega^{*T}x_i}{2}
\]</p>

<pre><code>I should add more intuition here!!!
</code></pre>

<p>Moreover, if we take a more careful look at the \(\omega = \sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_i y_ix_i\). Suppose we have fit our model&#39;s 
parameters to a training set, and now wish to make a prediction at a new point input \(x_{\text{new}}\). We would then calculate 
\(\omega^Tx_{\text{new}} +b\):
\[
\begin{aligned}
\omega^Tx_{\text{new}} + b = & \left( \sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_iy_ix_i\right)^T x_{\text{new}} + b \\
& = \sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_iy_i \langle x_i, x_{\text{new}}\rangle + b
\end{aligned}
\]</p>

<p>Hence, if we have found the \(\alpha_i\)&#39;s, in order to make a prediction, we have to calculate a quantity that depends only on 
the inner product between \(x_{\text{new}}\) and the points in the training set. And we know that the \(\alpha_i\)&#39;s will all be
zero except for the support vectors. Thus many of the terms in the sum above will be zero, and we only need to find the inner
products between \(x_{\text{new}}\) and the support vectors.</p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='kernel'>
<h3>Kernel</h3>

<p>As we noticed in the previous session, only the inner products between \(x_{\text{new}}\) and the support vectors is need for 
prediction of new observation. So applying Kernels to our classification problem will be able to efficiently learn in very 
high dimensional spaces.</p>

<h4>Feature mapping</h4>

<p>First of all, let&#39;s talk a little about <strong>attributes</strong> and <strong>features</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>attributes</strong>: is the original input value, like \(x\)</li>
<li><strong>features</strong>: is the original input \(x\) is mapped to some new set of quantities that are then passed to the model, like
\(x\), \(x^2\), \(x^3\)
We also let \(\phi\) denote the <strong>feature mapping</strong> which maps from the attributes to the features. For example, we can 
have 
\[\phi(x) = [x \;\;\; x^2 \;\;\; x^3]^T\]</li>
</ul>

<p>So rather than applying SVM using the original input attributes \(x\), we may instead want to learn using some features 
\(\phi(x)\). To do so, we simply need to go over our previous algorithm and replace \(x\) everywhere in it with \(\phi(x)\).</p>

<h4>Kernel and mapping</h4>

<p>Since the prediction of new point can be written entirely in terms of the inner products 
\(\langle x_i, x_{\text{new}}\rangle\), this means that we would replace all those inner products with 
\(\langle \phi(x_i), \phi(x_{\text{new}})\rangle\). Specifically, given a feature mapping \(\phi\), we define the 
<strong>corresponding Kernel</strong> to be
\[
K(x_i, x_{\text{new}}) = \phi(x_i)^T\phi(x_{\text{new}})
\]
Then everywhere we previously had \(\langle x_i, x_{\text{new}}\rangle\) in our algorithm, we could simply replace it
with \(K(x_i, x_{\text{new}})\), and the algorithm would now be learning using the features \(\phi\).</p>

<p>Now, given \(\phi\), we could easily compute \(K(x_i, x_{\text{new}})\) by finding \(\phi(x_i)\) and \(\phi(x_{\text{new}})\)
and taking their inner product. On the other hand, for a given \(K(\cdot, \cdot)\), we also could find a \(\phi\) which is
one-to-one correspondent to it. So there is a one-to-one correspondence between a feature mapping to a Kernel. What is
more interesting is that often, \(K(x_i, x_{\text{new}})\) may be very inexpensive to calculate, even though \(\phi(x)\)
itself may be very expensive to calculate, perhaps because it is an extremely high dimensional vector. </p>

<p>In such settings, by using in SVM an efficient way to calculate kernel \(K(\cdot, \cdot)\), we can get SVM to learn 
in the high dimensional feature space given by \(\phi\) but without ever having to calculate the \(\phi(x)\).
For example, suppose \(x,z \in \mathbb{R}^d\), and we define the kernel as:
\[
K(x,z) = (x^Tz)^2
\]
We can also write this as:
\[
\begin{aligned}
K(x,z) & = \left( \sum_{i=1}^d x_iz_i \right)\left( \sum_{i=1}^d x_iz_i \right) \\
& = \sum_{i=1}^d \sum_{j=1}^d (x_ix_j)(z_iz_j)
\end{aligned}
\]
Thus we see that \(K(x,z) =  \phi(x)^T\phi(z)\), where the feature mapping \(\phi\) is (shown here for the case of \(d=3\)):
\[
\phi(x) = [x_1x_1 \;\; x_1x_2 \;\; x_1x_3 \;\; x_2x_1 \;\; x_2x_2 \;\; x_2x_3 \;\; x_3x_1 \;\; x_3x_2 \;\; x_3x_3]^T
\]
So the \(\phi(x)\) is a mapping: \(\mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^{d^2}\).
Note that whereas calculating the high-dimensional \(\phi(x)\) requires \(O(n^2)\) time, however finding \(K(x,z)\) takes
only \(O(n)\) time.</p>

<p>In summary, Kernel methods owe their name to the use of kernel functions, which enable them to operate in a 
high-dimensional, implicit feature space without ever computing the coordinates of the data in that 
space, but rather by simply computing the inner products between the images of all pairs of data in the
feature space. This operation is often computationally cheaper than the explicit computation of the 
coordinates. This approach is called the &quot;kernel trick&quot;. </p>

<h4>Different view of Kernel</h4>

<p>From a different view of kernels, if \(\phi(x)\) and \(\phi(z)\) are close together, then we might expect \(K(x,z) = \phi(x)^T\phi(z)\)
to be large. Conversely, if \(\phi(x)\) and \(\phi(z)\) are far apart, say nearly orthogonal to each other, then 
\(K(x,z) = \phi(x)^T\phi(z)\) will be small. So we can think of \(K(x,z)\) as some measurement of how similar are
\(\phi(x)\) and \(\phi(z)\), or of how similar are \(x\) and \(z\).</p>

<p>Since there is a one-to-one correspondence between a feature mapping to a Kernel, we can either define a feature mapping
and then find the corresponding Kernel, or define a Kernel then find the corresponding mapping. But most of time
people prefer the second way, given some function \(K\), how can we tell if it is a valid kernel, which means how can we 
tell if there is some feature mapping \(\phi\) corresponds to it?</p>

<h4>Kernel matrix</h4>

<p>Suppose for now that \(K(\cdot, \cdot)\) is indeed a valid kernel corresponding to some feature mapping \(\phi\). We define a 
square, m-by-m matrix \(K\) that its \((i,j)\)-entry is given by \(K_{ij} = K(x_i, x_j)\). This matrix is called the <strong>Kernel matrix</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Kernel matrix must be symmetric since \(K_{ij} = K(x_i, x_j) = \phi(x_i)^T\phi(x_j) =  \phi(x_j)^T\phi(x_x) = K(x_j, x_i) = K_{ji}\) </li>
<li>Kernel matrix is positive semi-definite, since for any vector \(z\), we have 
\(z^TKz = \sum_i\sum_j z_iK_{ij}z_j = \sum_k\left(\sum_i z_i\phi_k(x_i)\right)^2 \ge 0\), \(k\) here is the index for \(k\)-th 
coordinate of the vector \(\phi(x)\).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Theorem (Mercer)</strong>
Let \(K: \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}\) be given. Then for \(K\) to be a valid kernel, it is necessary and
sufficient that for any \({x_i, \cdots, x_m}\), the corresponding kernel matrix is symmetric positive semi-definite.</p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='slack-variables'>
<h3>&quot;Slack&quot; Variables</h3>

<p>Previously, we introduced how to separate points by linearly separable hyperplane. But it is possible
that the large margin solution is better even though one constraint is violated.</p>

<p>So we permit to have functional margin less than 1 for some cases, such that 
\[y_i(\omega^Tx_i + b) \ge 1 - \xi_i\]
\[\xi_i \ge 0\] 
This \(\xi_i\) are called slack variables. For the support vectors, the functional 
margin is 
\[\gamma_i = y_i(\omega^Tx_i + b) = 1,\] 
which means \(\xi_i = 0\), and distance from support vectors to classification hyperplane is \(\frac{1}{\|\omega\|}\).
Originally, within either class, distance from any point to the classification hyperplane is larger or equal to 
the \(\frac{1}{\|\omega\|}\). But now since we permit have some cases that functional margin is less than 1, we will
have some cases that the distance from those points to the classification hyperplane are less than 1 or maybe 
even larger than 1 but on the other side. So in other words, there are two different situations for slack variable.</p>

<h4>Margin violation</h4>

<p>For this type of situation, we have <strong>\(0 < \xi_i \le 1\)</strong>. This means the distance between this type of points
and the hyperplane \(\omega^Tx + b\) is:
\[ 0 \le \frac{1 - \xi_i}{\|\omega\|} < \frac{1}{\|\omega\|}\]
The above distance greater or equal to zero means this point is still on the correct side of classification 
hyperplane. On the other hand, it should smaller than \(\frac{1}{\|\omega\|}\), which is the distance from 
support vector.</p>

<p>In summary, margin violation means we will permit a correct classification point but with smaller margin than
support vectors. One thing to keep in mind that the distance we are talking about here do not have a direction.
Which means we are talking about the distance for a point from a given class to the hyperplane. Later on we 
will see a negative distance, that means the distance is from the other side.</p>

<h4>Misclassified</h4>

<p>For this type of situation, we have <strong>\(\xi_i > 1\)</strong>. This means the distance between this type of points and the
hyperplane \(\omega^Tx + b\) is:
\[
\frac{1 - \xi_i}{\|\omega\|} < - \frac{1}{\|\omega\|}
\]
The magnitude of this distance is actually greater than \(\frac{1}{\|\omega\|}\), which is because the distance
is larger than the support vectors. However the negative sign with the distance means this point is misclassified
on the other side.</p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='regularization'>
<h3>Regularization</h3>

<p>Since we permit margin violation or misclassified points in our sample, we should add penalty on those points.
One thing should be noticed that if the \(\xi_i\) is sufficiently large, then constraint for every point can be
satisfied.</p>

<p>\[ 
\begin{aligned}
& \min_{\gamma, \omega, b} \frac{1}{2}||\omega||^2 + C\sum_{i=1}^{m} \xi_i \\
s.t. & y_i(\omega^Tx_i + b) \ge 1 - \xi_i \\
& \xi_i \ge 0
\end{aligned}
\]</p>

<p>C is the regularization parameter, </p>

<ul>
<li>If C is small, then all constraints are easily to be ignored. It means we can have relatively large \(\xi_i\)
and to have a large margin with many cases of margin violation and misclassification.</li>
<li>If C is large, then all constraints are hard to be ignored. It means we can have small \(\xi_i\) and to have a
narrow margin in order to avoid margin violation or misclassification.</li>
<li>If C is \(\infty\), then all constraints are enforced to be satisfied, which called hard margin. In this extreme
case, we do not have soft margin solution, and which goes back to original SVM.</li>
</ul>

<p>The value of C can also be viewed as a way to trade off between overfitting (high variance) and underfitting (high 
bias). </p>

<ul>
<li>If C is too small, it will cause the overfitting problem</li>
<li>If C is too large, it will then cause the underfitting problem.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then the optimization problem can be reformed using <strong>Lagrange multipliers</strong> method. Let us define 
the <strong>Lagrangian</strong> to be:</p>

<p>\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{L}(\omega, b, \xi, \alpha, r) = \frac{1}{2}\omega^T\omega + C\sum_{i=1}^m\xi_i - 
\sum_{i=1}^m\alpha_i[y_i(w^Tx_i + b) - 1 + \xi_i] - \sum_{i=1}^mr_i\xi_i
\end{aligned}
\]</p>

<p>Here \(\alpha_i\) and \(r_i\) are our Lagrange multipliers.
All optimal solutions must satisfy Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions:</p>

<p>\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial}{\partial \omega}\mathcal{L} =  \omega - \sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_i y_i x_i = 0 \\
\frac{\partial}{\partial b}\mathcal{L} = \sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_i y_i = 0 \\
\frac{\partial}{\partial \xi_i}\mathcal{L} = C - \alpha_i - r_i = 0 & \;\;\; i = 1, 2, \cdots, m \\
\alpha_i[y_i(x^Tx + b) - 1 + \xi_i] = 0 & \;\;\; i = 1, 2, \cdots, m \\
r_i\xi_i = 0 & \;\;\; i = 1, 2, \cdots, m \\
\alpha_i \ge 0 & \;\;\; i = 1, 2, \cdots, m \\
r_i \ge 0 & \;\;\; i = 1, 2, \cdots, m \\
-\xi_i \le 0 & \;\;\; i = 1, 2, \cdots, m \\
-[y_i(x^Tx + b) - 1 + \xi_i] \le 0 & \;\;\; i = 1, 2, \cdots, m
\end{aligned}
\]</p>

<p>First we look at the third condition. It can be rewrote as \(\alpha_i = C - r_i\), recall that \(r_i \ge 0\).
So we can get the condition for \(\alpha_i\) as:
\[0 \le \alpha_i \le C\]</p>

<p>The optimality conditions are both necessary and sufficient. If we have
\(C\), \(\xi\), b, \(\alpha\), and r satisfying the above conditions, we know that they represent optimal 
solutions to the primal and dual problems.</p>

<h4>In summary</h4>

<p>The regularization problem can be written as following:</p>

<p>We plug into \(\mathcal{L}(\omega, b, \xi, \alpha, r)\) with \(\omega = \sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_i y_i x_i\),
\(\sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_i y_i = 0\), and \(C - \alpha_i - r_i = 0\)</p>

<p>\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{L}(\omega, b, \xi, \alpha, r) & = \frac{1}{2}\omega^T\omega + \sum_{i=1}^m\alpha_i - \sum_{i=1}^m\alpha_iy_i
\omega^Tx_i - \sum_{i=1}^m\alpha_iy_ib + \sum_{i=1}^m(C - \alpha_i -r_i)\xi_i \\
& = \sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_i + \frac{1}{2}\omega^T\omega - \omega^T\omega \\
& = \sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_i - \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^m \alpha_i \alpha_j y_iy_j \langle x_i, x_j \rangle \\
& = e^T\alpha - \frac{1}{2}\alpha^TQ\alpha
\end{aligned}
\]
where \(e\) is the vector of all ones, \(\alpha\) is the vector of all \(\alpha_i\). \(Q_{ij} = y_iy_jK(x_i,x_j)\).
Then the optimization problem is:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\max_{\alpha} & W(\alpha) = \sum_{i=1}^m\alpha_i - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^m \alpha_i\alpha_j y_iy_j 
\langle x_i, x_j \rangle \\
s.t. & 0 \le \alpha_i \le C \;\;\; i = 1, \cdots, m \\
& \sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_iy_i = 0
\end{aligned}
\]</p>

<p>Also among all conditions, the KKT dual-complementarity conditions are:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\alpha_i[y_i(x^Tx + b) - 1 + \xi_i] = 0 & \;\;\; i = 1, 2, \cdots, m \\
r_i\xi_i = 0 & \;\;\; i = 1, 2, \cdots, m \\
\end{aligned}
\]
Then, we can have </p>

<ul>
<li>If \(\alpha_i = 0\), then \(y_i(x^Tx + b) - 1 + \xi_i > 0\), according to the third condition of KKT
\(r_i = C \Rightarrow \xi_i = 0 \Rightarrow y_i(x^Tx + b) > 1\)</li>
<li>If \(\alpha_i = C\), then according to the third condition of KKT, \(r_i = 0 \Rightarrow \xi_i >0\), 
\(y_i(x^Tx + b) - 1 + \xi_i = 0 \Rightarrow y_i(x^Tx + b) < 1\)</li>
<li>If \(0 < \alpha_i < C\), then \(y_i(x^Tx + b) - 1 + \xi_i = 0\), and \(r_i \ne 0 \Rightarrow \xi_i = 0\).
So \(y_i(x^Tx + b) = 1\)</li>
</ul>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='svm-and-logistic-regression'>
<h3>SVM and Logistic Regression</h3>

<p>There are a lot of similarity between the SVM and the logistic regression. In the logistic regression, we have our </p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='coordinate-ascent'>
<h3>Coordinate Ascent</h3>

<p>Consider trying to solve the unconstrained optimization problem
\[
\max_{\alpha}W(\alpha_1, \alpha_2,\cdots,\alpha_m)
\]
we are going to consider an algorithm named <strong>coordinate ascent</strong>:</p>

<p>\[
\begin{aligned}
&\text{Loop unitl convergence:} \{ \\
&\;\;\;\text{For} \; i = 1, \cdots, m \{ \\
&\;\;\;\;\;\; \alpha_i = \arg\max_{\alpha_i}W(\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_{i-1},\hat\alpha_i, \alpha_{i+1}, 
\cdots,\alpha_m) \\
&\;\;\;\} \\
&\}
\end{aligned}
\]</p>

<p>It is easy to find that in each iteration, we update \(W\) with respect to one of the \(\alpha_i\), then
we have a new \(W\) value with new \(\hat \alpha_i\) plugged in. And then we update the new 
\(W(\hat \alpha_i)\) with respect to the next \(\alpha_{i+1}\) until all \(\alpha_i\) have been updated. Those
all happened for every iteration.</p>

<p>Coordinate descent is a non-derivative optimization algorithm. To find a local minimum of a function,
we do <strong>line search along one coordinate direction</strong>, which is one \(\alpha_i\), at the current point in each 
iteration. We use different coordinate directions cyclically throughout the procedure.</p>

<h4>Gradient ascent</h4>

<p>Gradient ascent is a little different than coordinate ascent. 
To find a local minimum of a function using gradient descent, we take steps proportional to the negative 
of the gradient (or of the approximate gradient) of the function at the current point. If instead we take 
steps proportional to the positive of the gradient, one approaches a local maximum of that function; the 
procedure is then known as gradient ascent.</p>

<p>In coordinate ascent, we update all \(\alpha_i\) one by one in each iteration. In other words, we updated 
the objective function by plugging in the new estimate \(\hat \alpha_i\).</p>

<p>On the other hand, gradient ascent will update all \(\alpha_i\) simultaneously within each iteration.
\[
\begin{aligned}
&\text{Loop unitl convergence:} \{ \\
&\;\;\;\;\;\; \alpha_1 = \alpha_1 + \gamma \frac{\partial}{\partial \alpha_1}W \\
&\;\;\;\;\;\; \cdots \\
&\;\;\;\;\;\; \alpha_d = \alpha_d + \gamma \frac{\partial}{\partial \alpha_d}W \\
&\}
\end{aligned}
\]
where \(\gamma\) is the  a step size (sometimes called the learning rate in machine learning). Here the dimension
of \(\alpha\) is same as the \(x_i\), previously in SVM we have dimension of \(\alpha\) is \(m\) which is the number 
of data point.</p>

<h4>Stochastic gradient ascent</h4>

<p>Here is an extension of gradient ascent which called stochastic gradient ascent. Back to gradient ascent,
the gradient \(\partial W / \partial\alpha_i\) should be calculated based on all data \(x_i\), like in the linear
regression, gradient is 
\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial\alpha_j} W = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m (W(x_i) - y_i)x_{ij}
\]
Every time when we update one \(\alpha_i\), we have to scan the whole dataset into memory. When the dataset is 
large, this is extremely inefficient.</p>

<p>Another method which can overcome this problem is called stochastic gradient ascent. Still take the linear 
regression as example. Previously, the objective cost function is a summation of error square for each data
point. So each data point we have an objective term: \(W_i = \frac{1}{2}(W(x_i) - y_i)^2\), and the gradients are
\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial\alpha_j} W_i = (W(x_i) - y_i)x_{ij}
\]
So we have an objective function for each data point. Then for each objective function, we can update every
\(\alpha_i\).
\[
\begin{aligned}
& \text{First randomly shuffle dataset} \\
& \text{Loop unitl convergence:} \{ \\
& \;\;\;\;\;\; \text{For} i = 1, \cdots, m \{ \\
& \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; \alpha_1 = \alpha_1 + \gamma \frac{\partial}{\partial \alpha_1} W_i \\ 
& \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; \cdots \\
& \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; \alpha_d = \alpha_d + \gamma \frac{\partial}{\partial \alpha_d} W_i \\
& \;\;\;\;\;\; \} \\
& \}
\end{aligned}
\]
Learning rate \(\gamma\) is typically held constant, but can also slowly decreased over iteration time if we want
\(\alpha\) to converge, like \(\gamma = \frac{constant1}{iterationtime + constant2}\).</p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='smo-procedure'>
<h3>SMO Procedure</h3>

<p>The (dual) optimization problem that we want to solve:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\min_{\alpha} & W(\alpha) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^m \alpha_i\alpha_j y_iy_j 
\langle x_i, x_j \rangle - \sum_{i=1}^m\alpha_i \\
s.t. & 0 \le \alpha_i \le C \;\;\; i = 1, \cdots, m \\
& \sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_iy_i = 0
\end{aligned}
\]
Let&#39;s say we have set of \(\alpha_i\)&#39;s that satisfy the two constrints. Then our plan is to use coordinate descent 
to solve the optimization problem. Recall that in the corrdinate ascent/descent method, we only update one \(\alpha_i\)
and fix the rest of \(\alpha\) to be constant each time. Here we have one problem if we follow the original coordinate
descent. Becasue of the linear constraint of all \(\alpha_i\), a linear combination of any two \(\alpha_i\) will be a 
constant. So we have to update two \(\alpha_i\) in each step of coordinate descent.</p>

<p>Every step of SMO, we selection some pair of \(\alpha_i\) and \(\alpha_j\) to update next, and then reoptimize \(W(\alpha)\)
with respect to \(\alpha_i\) and \(\alpha_j\), while holding all the other \(\alpha\)&#39;s fixed.</p>

<h4>How it works:</h4>

<p>Later on we will discuss how to choose these two \(\alpha_i\)&#39;s, here let&#39;s assume we want to work on \(\alpha_1\) and 
\(\alpha_2\). So we fix \(\alpha_3, \cdots, \alpha_m\), also we assume that the initial value of \(\alpha\) satisfy
\[
\sum_{i=1}^m \alpha_iy_i = 0
\]
Then we will have
\[
\alpha_1y_1 + \alpha_2y_2 = \xi
\]
Here \(\xi\) is a constant. Suppose \(\alpha_1\) and \(\alpha_2\) are the updated value in \(k\)&#39;th step, and 
\(\alpha_1^*\) and \(\alpha_2^*\) are the value in \((k-1)\)&#39;th step, and we assume that all \(\alpha_i^*\) 
satisfy the two constraints in the original problem. So we are trying to update from 
\(\alpha_1^*\) and \(\alpha_2^*\) to \(\alpha_1\) and \(\alpha_2\). Still we have following linear constraint for
old \(\alpha\)&#39;s:
\[
\alpha_1y_1 + \alpha_2y_2 = \alpha_1^*y_1 + \alpha_2^*y_2 = \xi
\]
So, our SMO procedure basically is trying to calculate \(\alpha_1\) and \(\alpha_2\) given \(\alpha_1^*\) and
\(\alpha_2^*\) in each step. Let \(s = y_1y_2\), and \(y_1y_1 = y_2y_2 =1\). Then multiply \(y_1\) on each side
of above constraint we have:
\[
\alpha_1 + s\alpha_2 = \alpha_1^* + s\alpha_2^* = \xi = -y_1 \sum_{i=3}^m y_i\alpha_i^*
\]
We also have:
\[
\alpha_1 = \xi - s\alpha_2
\]
Further more, we define the following variables:
\[
u_1 = \sum_{i=1}^m y_i\alpha_i^*K(x_i,x_1) + b^* \;\;\;\; \text{and} \;\;\;\;
u_2 = \sum_{i=1}^m y_i\alpha_i^*K(x_i,x_2) + b^* 
\]
It is not hard to notice that \(u_1\) and \(u_2\) are the estimated value for \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) based on the
current parameter estimates \(\alpha_1^*\), \(\alpha_2^*\), and \(b^*\). \(K(\cdot, \cdot)\) is basically the
kernel function, later on we will use \(K_{ij}\) to represent the \(ij\)&#39;th element in the kernel matrix. </p>

<p>Since we can use \(\alpha_2\) to replace \(\alpha_1\), in objective function \(W\) can be rewrote as a function
with respect to \(\alpha_2\) only, and any other terms that are not related to \(\alpha_2\) can be treated
as constant:
\[
\begin{aligned}

\[

\end{aligned}

Now it is very clear that our objective \(W(\alpha_2)\) is a quadratic function with respect to \(\alpha_2\).
One more thing should be recalled that the \(\alpha_2\) can only be with in \((0, C)\) and \(\alpha_1\) is in 
\((0, C)\), \(\alpha_1y_1 + \alpha_2y_2 = \xi\). And we know that the 
optimization of the \(W(\alpha_2)\) will only be at either the endpoint or the \(\alpha_2\) such that 
\(W'(\alpha_2) = 0\). So let us first have a look at what is the function value at the endpoints.</p>

<p>There are two different situations for the endpoints of \(\alpha_2\):</p>

<p><strong>When \(y_1\) and \(y_2\) are same</strong> 
<img src="./figures/smo1.png" alt="y1 and y2 are different"></p>

<p>As in the figure, possible value of \(\alpha_1\) and \(\alpha_2\) first should be located in the dash square.
Plus \(\alpha_1\) and \(\alpha_2\) should be on the line \(\alpha_1 - \alpha_2 = \xi\). If the line is the 
upper one, then we can see \(0 < \alpha_1 < C-\xi\) and \(\xi < \alpha_2 < C\). Or if is the lower line, 
then we have \(\xi < \alpha_1 < C\) and \(0 < \alpha_2 < C-\xi\).</p>
