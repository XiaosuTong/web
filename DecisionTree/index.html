<h3>In Short</h3>

<h4>What is DT</h4>

<p>A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure in which each internal node represents a &quot;test&quot; on 
an attribute (e.g. whether a coin flip comes up heads or tails), each branch represents the outcome 
of the test and each leaf node represents a class label (decision taken after computing all 
attributes). The paths from root to leaf represents classification rules.</p>

<p>Tree models where the target variable can take a finite set of values are called classification 
trees. In these tree structures, leaves represent class labels and branches represent conjunctions 
of features that lead to those class labels. Decision trees where the target variable can take 
continuous values (typically real numbers) are called regression trees.</p>

<h4>Why is DT</h4>

<div class='tab-pane' id='more-about-dt'>
<h3>More about DT</h3>

<p>A decision tree is a simple representation for classifying examples. Decision tree learning is one 
of the most successful techniques for supervised classification learning. Assume that all of the 
features have finite discrete domains, and there is a single target feature called the 
classification (\(Y\)). Each element of the domain of the classification is called a class. A decision tree 
or a classification tree is a tree in which each internal (non-leaf) node is labeled with an input 
feature (\(X_i\)). </p>

<p>A tree can be &quot;learned&quot; by splitting the source set into subsets based on an attribute value test. 
This process is repeated on each derived subset in a recursive manner called recursive partitioning. 
The recursion is completed when the subset at a node has all the same value of the target variable, 
or when splitting no longer adds value to the predictions. This process of top-down induction of 
decision trees (TDIDT) is an example of a greedy algorithm, and it is by far the most common strategy 
for learning decision trees from data.</p>

<p>Here is a very simple pseudocode:</p>

<p>\[
\begin{aligned}
 & \textbf{GROWTREE(S)} \\
 & \textbf{if} ( y = 0 \;\; \text{for} \;\; \text{all} (x,y) \in S) \\
 & \;\;\;\; \textbf{return} \;\; \text{new} \;\; \text{leaf(0)} \\
 & \textbf{else} \;\; \textbf{if} ( y = 1 \;\; \text{for} \;\; \text{all} (x,y) \in S) \\
 & \;\;\;\; \textbf{return} \;\; \text{new} \;\; \text{leaf(1)} \\
 & \textbf{else} \\
 & \;\;\;\; \text{choose best attribute} \;\; x_j \\
 & \;\;\;\; S_0 = \text{all} (x,y) \in S \text{with} x_j = 0 \\
 & \;\;\;\; S_1 = \text{all} (x,y) \in S \text{with} x_j = 1 \\
 & \;\;\;\; \textbf{return} \text{new} \;\; \text{node}(x_j, \textbf{GROWTREE}(S_0), \textbf{GROWTREE}(S_1))
\end{aligned}
\]</p>

<div class='tab-pane' id='types'>
<h3>Types</h3>

<h4>Types of tree</h4>

<p>Decision trees used in data mining are of two main types:</p>

<ul>
<li>Classification tree analysis is when the predicted outcome is the class to which the data belongs.</li>
<li>Regression tree analysis is when the predicted outcome can be considered a real number (e.g. the 
price of a house, or a patient’s length of stay in a hospital).</li>
</ul>

<p>The term Classification And Regression Tree (CART) analysis is an umbrella term used to refer to both 
of the above procedures. Trees used for regression and trees used for classification have some 
similarities - but also some differences, such as the procedure used to determine where to split.</p>

<p>Decision tree learning is the construction of a decision tree from class-labeled training tuples. A 
decision tree is a flow-chart-like structure, where each internal (non-leaf) node denotes a test on 
an attribute, each branch represents the outcome of a test, and each leaf (or terminal) node holds 
a class label. The topmost node in a tree is the root node.</p>

<h4>Types of algorithms</h4>

<p>There are many specific decision-tree algorithms. Notable ones include:</p>

<ul>
<li>ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3)</li>
<li>C4.5 (successor of ID3)</li>
<li>CART (Classification And Regression Tree)</li>
<li>CHAID (CHi-squared Automatic Interaction Detector). Performs multi-level splits when computing 
classification trees.</li>
<li>MARS: extends decision trees to handle numerical data better.</li>
<li>Conditional Inference Trees. Statistics-based approach that uses non-parametric tests as splitting 
criteria, corrected for multiple testing to avoid overfitting. This approach results in unbiased 
predictor selection and does not require pruning.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Types of decision nodes</h4>

<p>Depending upon the decision node of a tree, decision trees for continuous attributes can be divided
into three categories:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Univariate decision trees</strong>
At each node, they take the decision on one attribute. They create orthogonal splits (orthogonal to 
the attributes). They are computationally efficient, however, if the decision boundaries are not
orthogonal to a attribute’s axis, they are generally not very accurate. C4.5 and CART are examples 
of these kinds of trees.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Linear Multivariate decision trees</strong>
It overcome the representational limitation of univariate decision trees. Linear multivariate 
decision trees allow the node to test a linear combination of the numeric attributes. This test can 
be presented as:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{m} c_ix_i \le \theta
\]
where \(x_i\) are the numeric attributes, \(c_i\) are the corresponding real valued coefficients, and 
\(\theta\) is a numeric constant. These trees are also called oblique decision trees as they uses 
oblique (non-axis-parallel) hyperplanes to partition the data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Omnivariate decision trees</strong>
At each node, they can take decisions on the nonlinear combination of attributes. They have better
representational power than univariate decision trees and linear univariate decision trees.</p></li>
</ul>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='pick-node'>
<h3>Pick node</h3>

<p>This session can also be phrased as how to choose the attribute based on which the data will be
splited. It is not hard to notice how we choose the attributes or nodes totally effects the performance
of the tree. First of all, let us have a look at several possible methods to calculate the impurity
of a set with several levels value, which is the case for our target variable \(Y\).</p>

<h4>Regression error</h4>

<p>If we are working with the regression tree that our target \(Y\) is a continuous variable. The impurity
of one set of examples would be just the MSE:
\[
\text{Impurity}(D) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - \bar y)^2
\]
Here everytime we got a split of dataset, we use the mean of \(Y\) in that subset to represent the 
value of \(y\) in that subset.</p>

<p>After we calculated the error of each subsets, we will try to learn branching criteria:
\[
b(X) = \arg \min_{\text{all decision stumps}} \sum_{c=1}^m \frac{\|D_c\|}{N}\text{impurity}(D_c)
\]
where \(b(x)\) is the attributes of the best choice for splitting, \(m\) is total number of sub-tree splitted 
into, \(\frac{\|D_c\|}{N}\) is the weight for each sub-tree impurity, the sub-tree with more elements will 
have larger weight.</p>

<h4>Classification error</h4>

<p>The most naive way to choose the attributes can be: we just simply predict all examples in one subset 
to be same as the majority in that subset. Then calculate the misclassification count in two children. 
We can do a greedy search to find which attribute can give us the lost misclassification rate. So
\[
\text{Impurity}(D) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (y_i \ne y^*)
\]
where \(y^*\) is the majority of \(\{y_i\}\) in the group.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this measure does not always work well, because it does not detect where we are
making &quot;progress&quot; toward a good tree.</p>

<p>Suppose we have examples that belongs to two classes based on \(y\) value. 20 in one class, 10 in another.
We then split the data based on maybe \(x_1\). Now we have 12/8 in subset one, and 8/2 in subset two. 
Let&#39;s assume that next step we split the two subsets based on \(x_2\) and \(x_3\) respectively, and we got
12/0, 0/8 for the first subset, and 8/0, 0/2 for the second subset. So we found that from original
dataset to the first splitting, the error rate did not change which are all 10, which means we did 
not make any progress. But the fact is we are.</p>

<p>After we calculated the error of each subsets, we will try to learn branching criteria:
\[
b(X) = \arg \min \sum_{c=1}^m \frac{\|D_c\|}{N}\text{impurity}(D_c)
\]</p>

<h4>Gini impurity</h4>

<p>Gini impurity is a measure of how often a randomly chosen element from the set would be incorrectly 
labeled if it were randomly labeled according to the distribution of labels in the subset. Gini 
impurity can be computed by summing the probability of each item being chosen times the probability 
of a mistake in categorizing that item. It reaches its minimum (zero) when all cases in the node 
fall into a single target category.</p>

<p>To compute Gini impurity for a set of items, suppose \(c \in\) \(\{1, 2, \cdots, m\}\), which is all
possible levels of \(Y\). And let \(f_c\) be the fraction of items labeled with value \(c\) in the set.
\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{impurity}(D) = I_G & = \sum_{c=1}^m f_c(1 - f_c) = 1 - \sum_{i=c}^m f_c^2 \\
& = 1 - \sum_{c=1}^m \left( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N\|y_i = c\|}{N} \right)^2
\end{aligned}
\]
Every sub-group \(D_c\) has same Gini impurity calculation, but with different value.
After we calculated the Gini impurity of each subsets, we will try to learn branching criteria:
\[
b(X) = \arg \min \sum_{c=1}^m \frac{\|D_c\|}{N}\text{impurity}(D_c)
\] 
Impurity calculation here is actually similar to the impurity in classification error. Here the 
impurity considers all sub-group together since we have \(\sum_{c=1}^m\) over all \(c\). However in
classification error, we can rewrite the impurity to be: 
\[
1 - \max_{c} \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N \|y_i=c\|}{N}
\]
only one sub-group \(c\) is considered to be the optimal.</p>

<h4>Information gain</h4>

<p>Another method to choose the best attribute is based on <strong>Information Theory</strong>.</p>

<p>For a given random variable \(V\), discrete for example, the <strong>surprise</strong> of each value of \(V\) is defined
to be:
\[
S(V=v) = - \log P(V=v)
\]
Then the <strong>Entropy</strong> of random variable \(V\) would be:
\[
H(V) = \sum_{v} - P(V=v) \log P(V=v) = E_{V}(- \log P(V))
\]
So the Entropy of random variable is nothing but the expectation value of the surprise function.</p>

<p>What we will use to help us to choose the attribute is the <strong>Mutual Information</strong>. Assume we have
two random variable \(Y\) and \(X\). The mutual information between \(Y\) and \(X\) is the amount of information
we learn about \(Y\) by knowing the value of \(X\) (it is symmetric). It is computed as follows:
\[
\begin{aligned}
I(Y;X) & = H(Y) - \sum_{x}P(X=x)H(Y|X=x) \\
& = H(Y) - \sum_{x}P(X=x) \sum_{y} - P(Y=y|X=x) \log P(Y=y|X=x) \\
& = H(Y) - \sum_{x}\sum_{y} P(x,y) \log P(Y=y|X=x) \\
& = H(Y) - E_{X,Y} (\log P(Y=y|X=x))
\end{aligned}
\]</p>

<p>Here is one problem, if attribute has many values or levels, Gain will select it because it can perfect
split our data. One approach is using <strong>GainRatio</strong> instead:
\[
\begin{aligned}
& GainRatio(S,A) = \frac{I(S;A)}{SplitInformation(S,A)} \\
& SplitInformation(S,A) = - \sum_{i=1}^c \frac{|S_i|}{|S|}\log\frac{|S_i|}{|S|}
\end{aligned}
\]
where \(S_i\) is subset of \(S\) for which \(A\) has value \(v_i\). This SplitInformation is nothing but the
sum of Entropy of target variable \(Y\) over all subsets based on \(X\) splitting variable. Finally, 
we just learn branching criteria by minimize the GainRatio.</p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='missing-value'>
<h3>Missing Value</h3>

<p>What if some examples are misiing values of A? There are several options can be considered, they 
all based on imputing the missing value:</p>

<ul>
<li>If node n tests A, assign most common value of A among other examples at node n.</li>
<li>Assign most common value of A among other examples with same target value.</li>
<li>Assign probability \(p_i\) to each possible value \(v_i\) of \(A\). The example that has \(A\) missing
will be splited to m examples if \(A\) has m different levels. Now those examples will have 
probability as the value of \(Y\) instead of 1 or 0 as before. Classify new examples in same fashion.</li>
</ul>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='overfitting'>
<h3>Overfitting</h3>

<p>Let us revisit the overfitting defination again here. Consider error of hypothesis \(h\) over</p>

<ul>
<li>training data: \(error_T(h)\)</li>
<li>entire distribution \(D\) of data: \(error_D(h)\)</li>
</ul>

<p>Hypothesis \(h \in H\) <strong>overfits</strong> training data if there is an alternative hypothesis \(h' \in H\)
such that
\[
error_T(h) < error_T(h')
\]
and
\[
error_D(h) > error_D(h')
\]
So it is saying that our hypothesis or fitted model based on training data is not doing a good job 
on validation data or in general. The model is too complex without any generalization. In the 
decision tree case, the complexity of a tree is defined by the number of levels of the tree. The
more levels we have in the tree, the more complex the tree is. More levels means we choose more
variables to split the data. If we have a lot of levels, we will end up with very few examples in
each leaf which is not the generalization case.</p>

<p>How can we avoid overfitting in decision tree?</p>

<ul>
<li>Stop growing when data splitting is not statistically significant</li>
<li>Grow a full tree, then post-prune</li>
<li>Pre-prune the tree before grow the node</li>
</ul>

<p>Regardless of whether the correct tree size is found by stopping early or by post-pruning, a key 
question is what criterion is to be used to determine the correct final tree size. Approaches include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use a separate set of examples, distinct from the training examples, validation dataset to evaluate
the utility of post-pruning nodes from the tree.</li>
<li>Use all the available data for training, but apply a statistical test to estimate whether expanding
or pruning a particular node is likely to produce an improvement beyond the training set. For example
a chi-square test to estimate whether further expanding a node is likely to improve performance over
the entire instance distribution, or only on the current sample of training data.</li>
<li>Add complexity penalty to performance measure. Use an explicit measure of the complexity for
encoding the training examples and the decision tree.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Reduced error pruning</h4>

<p>In summary, post-pruning is bettern than pre-pruning.</p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='blending'>
<h3>Blending</h3>

<p>Suppose we have \(h_1, \cdots, h_T\) prediction for the same event which using different hypothesis or
different model. Be more specifically \(h_i\) can be the classification result (\(-1\) or \(1\)) from different
models.</p>

<h4>Type</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Select the most trust-worthy hypothesis, which is the most basic method: model selection
based on evaluation dataset, cross validation.</p></li>
<li><p>mix the predictions from all the hypothesis uniformly</p></li>
<li><p>mix the predictions from all the hypothesis non-uniformly</p></li>
<li><p>combine the predictions conditionally</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Selection</h4>

<p>\[ H(x) = h_{t_*}(x) \;\;\; s.t. \;\;\; t_* = \arg\min_{t} MSE(eval) \]</p>

<h4>Uniform blending</h4>

<p>For known \(h_t\) each with weight 1.
\[
H(x) = \sum_{t=1}^T 1 \cdot h_t(x)
\]
For regression, uniform blending can be:
\[
H(x) = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T h_t(x)
\]
very different \(h_t\), average could be more accurate than individual. Diversity is better.</p>

<p><strong>Theory</strong>
Suppose the true value of prediction for given \(x\) is \(f(x)\), we can examine the mean square error as follow:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T( h_t(x) - f(x))^2 & = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T (h_t^2(x) - 2h_t(x)f(x) + f^2(x)) \\
& = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T h_t^2(x) - 2f(x)H(x) + f^2(x) \\
& = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T h_t^2(x) - H^2(x) + ( H(x) - f(x))^2 \\
& = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T h_t^2(x) - 2H^2(x) + H^2(x) + (H(x) - f(x))^2 \\
& = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T ( h_t^2(x) - 2H(x)h_t(x) + H^2(x)) + (H(x) - f(x))^2 \\
& = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T (h_t(x) - H(x))^2 + (H(x) - f(x))^2
\end{aligned}
\]
For any \(x\) we can still get the same formula as above only replacing to be the expectation:
\[
\frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T E_x(h_t - f)^2 = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T E_x(h_t - G)^2 + E_x(H - f)^2 \\
\frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T E_x(h_t - f)^2 \ge E_x(H - f)^2
\]
This is nothing but a bias-variance decomposition of mean square error. By doing blending, we are actually
trying to reduce the variance </p>

<h4>Linear blending</h4>

<p>The difference between linear blending and uniform blending is that we assign different weights to the
known \(h_t(x)\).
\[
H(x) = \sum_{t=1}^T \alpha_t \cdot h_t(x)
\]
There is a restriction which is \(\alpha_t \ge 0\). But this restriction can be removed if we are facing
a classification. If \(\alpha_t < 0\) then we just set \(\alpha_th_t(x) = |\alpha_t|\cdot(-h_t(x))\). So we
just flip the classification result from \(h_t(x)\).</p>

<p>Without the positive restriction of \(\alpha_t\), the original problem of linear blending can be solved as
\[
\alpha = \arg\min \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N \left( y_n - \sum_{t=1}^T \alpha_th_t(x_n) \right)^2
\]<br>
This is just a linear regression of \(y_n\) to the \(x_n\) after transformation. If we assume the \(x_n\) is
in dimension d, then we just transformed \(x_n\) into \(h(x_n)\) within dimension T.</p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='bagging'>
<h3>Bagging</h3>

<p>Bagging sometimes also is called as Bootstrap Aggregation. In the blending session, we assumed we have
already knew all the \(h_t\), then we aggregated all those known \(h_t\) together.</p>

<p>The diversity of \(h_t\) is important, it will give us better result with larger diversity.</p>

<ul>
<li>diversity can be different models</li>
<li>diversity can be different tuning parameters</li>
<li>diversity can be the different starting point in the algorithm</li>
<li>diversity can be the data randomness</li>
</ul>

<p>Data randomness can be achieved by bootstrapping: \(D_t\) re-sample N examples from the original dataset \(D\)
uniformly with replacement.</p>

<p>Then we apply the model \(h\) to the \(D_t\) to get the estimate \(h_t\), and blending can be used to average
the \(h_t\).</p>

<div class='tab-pane' id='example-bagging'>
<h3>Example bagging</h3>

<p>Given a training dataset \((x_1, y_1), \cdots, (x_N, y_N)\), bagging repeatedly selects a random sample with replacement
of the training dataset and fits trees using these samples.</p>

<p>After training, predictions for unseen samples \(x_{\text{new}}\) can be made by averaging the predictions from all
the individual regression trees on \(x_{\text{new}}\):
\[
\hat h_f = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T \hat h_t(x_{\text{new}}) 
\]
or by taking the majority vote in the case of decision trees for categorical \(y\)</p>

<p>This bootstrapping procedure leads to better model performance because it decreases the variance of the model,
without increasing the bias. This means that while the predictions of a single tree are highly sensitive to noise
in training dataset, the average of many trees is not, as long as the trees are not correlated. And this is why
we would like our trees as different as possible, or diversity is as large as possible. Bootstrap sampling is a 
way of de-correlating the trees by showing them different training dataset.</p>

<p>Each run t of bagging can be easily embarrasing parallel achieved.</p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='random-features'>
<h3>Random features</h3>

<p>The previous session describes the original bagging algorithm for trees. Another type of random forests differ 
in only one way from the general scheme: they use a modified tree learning algorithm that selects, at each 
candidate split in the learning process, a random subset of the features. This process is sometimes called 
&quot;feature bagging&quot;.</p>

<p>The reason for doing this is the correlation of the trees in an ordinary bootstrap sample: if one or a few
features are very strong predictors for the response variable, these features will be selected in many of the 
\(T\) trees, causing them to become correlated.</p>

<p>Feature bagging can also be understood as diversifying by feature projection. Sampling \(d'\) features from \(x\)
which \(x \in \mathbb{R}^d\) is just a projection from \(\mathbb{R}^d\) to \(\mathbb{R}^{d'}\), 
\(\Phi(x) = (x_{i_1}, x_{i_2}, \cdots, x_{i_{d'}})\). Here \(x_{i_1}\) means \(i_1\)&#39;th column of \(X\) matrix, not row.
\[
\Phi(x) \in \mathbb{R}^{d'}: \text{a random subspace of} \;\; x \in \mathbb{R}^d
\]
often \(d' \ll d\).</p>

<p>Everytime we are trying to choose the node by calling \(b(x)\) function which find the attributes to minimizes
the impurity, we can use random feature re-sampling. </p>

<p>So far, the random forest can be done with a combination of bagging and random-subspace decision trees.
So within each iteration \(t\), we first bootstrap to get \(N\) examples, everytime we choose a node when building
the tree, we randomly sample \(d'\) features out of \(d\) total features to be our potential node features.</p>

<h4>More randomness</h4>

<p>Previously, we introduced how to introduce more diversity of \(h_t\) by random features. So for each observation 
or example \(x_i\) we can apply a transformation \(P_{d' \times d}\) to it. Each row of \(P_{d' \times d}\) is sampled
randomly from the natural basis of \(\mathbb{R}^d\). One example of \(P\) could be:
\[
P_{d',d} =
 \begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
  0 & 0 & \cdots & 1 \\
  \vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots  \\
  0 & 1 & \cdots & 0
 \end{pmatrix} 
\]
It is not hard to conclude that each row of \(P\) should be orthogonal to each other since they are all natural 
basis.</p>

<p>However, this is not the last thing we can do to include more randomness of \(h_t\). Instead of having projection
vectors randomly sampled from natureal basis, we can consider the projection is a combination of all features
of each example \(x_i\), \(i\)&#39;th row of design matrix \(X\). An example would be:
\[
P_{d',d} =
 \begin{pmatrix}
  0.3 & 0.1 & \cdots & 0.6 \\
  0.25 & 0.33 & \cdots &  0\\
  \vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots  \\
  0 & 0.7 & \cdots & 0.3
 \end{pmatrix} 
\]
Assume the number of non-zero components in each row of \(P\) is \(d''\), we often consider low-dimensional projection,
which means \(d'' \ll d\). If \(d'' = 1\), it becomes to the natural basis projection. </p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='out-of-bag'>
<h3>Out of Bag</h3>

<p>In the bagging, we are bootstrap \(N\) samples within each run \(t\). For each run \(t\), some of the examples are not 
used. Or we can say for each example \((x_i, y_i)\), some of \(h_t\) use it. We call example \((x_i, y_i)\) 
<strong>out-of-bag(OOB)</strong> example of \(h_t\).</p>

<h4>Number of OOB</h4>

<p>Assume we sample \(N\) examples in each run of bootstrap. So the probability for \((x_i,y_i)\) to be <strong>OOB</strong> for \(h_t\)
is:
\[
\left( 1 - \frac{1}{N} \right)^N = \frac{1}{\left(\frac{N}{N-1}\right)^N} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{1}{N-1}\right)} \approx \frac{1}{e}
\]
So for each \(h_t\), <strong>OOB</strong> size is \(\frac{1}{e}N\). These examples can be used as a validation dataset to judge the 
model fitting or tunning model parameters. However, we are not interested in the performance of each \(h_t\) because
we expect those \(h_t\) to be weak learning method individually. What we do care about is the performance of overall
\(H\). </p>

<h4>Self-validation</h4>

<p>For example, \((x_i, y_i)\) is not sampled for \(h_1, h_3, h_T\), and is sampled for \(h_2, h_4, \cdots, h_{T-1}\). 
We can use \((x_i, y_i)\) to evaluate trees of which it is OOB, such as \(H'_i(x_i) = \frac{1}{3} \sum_{t}^{1,3,T} h_t\).
So the mean error of \(H\) is
\[
E_{OOB}(H) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N err(y_i, H'_i(x_i))
\]
where \(H'_i\) is a small version of random forest based on restricted number of bagging trees. This is similar to 
the leave-one-out cross validation.</p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='boosting'>
<h3>Boosting</h3>

<p>Boosting refers to a general and provably effefctive method of producing a very accurate prediction
rule by combining rough and moderately inaccurate hypothesis.</p>

<h4>Background</h4>

<p>Rough and moderately inaccurate hypothesis is a very vague defination with respect to the machine 
learning hypothesis. If we want to define it with more accuracy, we need some basic idea about PAC 
learning model. Boosting actually has its roots in a theoretical framework for studying machine 
learning called the “PAC” learning model, due to Valiant. Kearns and Valiant were the first to 
pose the question of whether a “weak” learning algorithm which performs just slightly better than 
random guessing in the PAC model can be “boosted” into an arbitrarily accurate “strong” learning 
algorithm.</p>

<p>Schapire came up with the first provable polynomial-time boosting algorithm in 1989. Paper showed 
that any weak learning algorithm can be efficiently transformed or boosted into a strong learning 
algorithm. A year later, Freund presented the &quot;boost-by-majority&quot; algorithm that is considerably more
efficient than Schapire&#39;s developed a much more efficient boosting algorithm which, although optimal 
in a certain sense, nevertheless suffered from certain practical drawbacks.</p>

<p>Both algorithms work by calling a given weak learning algorithm <strong>WeakLearn</strong> multiple times, each time 
presenting it with a different distribution over the domain \(X\), and finally combining all of the 
generated hypotheses into a single hypothesis. The intuitive idea is to alter the distribution over 
the domain \(X\) in a way that increases the probability of the <strong>harder</strong> parts of the space, thus 
forcing the weak learner to generate new hypotheses that make less mistakes on these parts.</p>

<p>However, an important, practical deficiency of the boost-by-majority algorithm is the requirement 
that the bias of the weak learning algorithm <strong>WeakLearn</strong> be known ahead of time. Not only is this 
worst-case bias usually unknown in practice, but the bias that can be achieved by <strong>WeakLearn</strong>
will typically vary considerably from one distribution to the next. Unfortunately, the boost-by-majority 
algorithm cannot take advantage of hypotheses computed by <strong>WeakLearn</strong> with error significantly 
smaller than the presumed worst-case bias of \(\frac{1}{2} - \gamma\).</p>

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='adaboost'>
<h3>AdaBoost</h3>

<p><strong>AdaBoost</strong> is a new boosting algorithm developed by Freund after the <strong>boost-by-majority</strong> algorithm. It
is a boosting by sampling method.</p>

<p>We assume that a sequence of \(N\) traning examples \((x_1, y_1), \cdots, (x_N, y_N)\) is drawn randomly from
\(X \times Y\) according to fixed but unknown distribution \(\mathscr{P}\). We use boosting to find a hypothesis
\(h_f\) which is consistent with most of the sample (i.e. \(h_f(x_i) = y_i\) for most \(1 \le i \le N\)). In
general, a hypothesis which is accurate on the training set might not be accurate on examples outside the
training set; this problem is sometimes referred to as overfitting. Often, overfitting can be avoided by
restricting the hypothesis to be simple so that generalization error is closed to the empirical error on 
the training dataset. Or we can view this issue from the prespective of bagging. In the bagging method,
we are shown that the final aggregation is better if the diversity of each \(h_t\) is large. Here the we can
increase the diversity of each <strong>WeakLearn</strong> by restricting them to be simple.</p>

<p>AdaBoost calls a given weak or base learning algorithm repeatedly in a series of
rounds \(t=1,\cdots, T\). One of the main ideas of the algorithm is to maintain a distribution or set of
weights over the training dataset. The weight of this distribution on training example \(i\) on round \(t\) is
denoted \(D_t(i)\). Initially, all weights are set equally, but on each round, the weights of incorrectly
classified examples are increased so that the weak learner is forced to focus on the hard examples
in the training set.</p>

<p>First let us assume all \(h_t\) are continuous function mapping \(x_i\) to \([0,1]\). This assumption is valid if
we are considering logisitic regression as the weak hypotheses. \(h_t\) now is nothing but the fitted 
probability of success \(\hat \pi_i\), \(h_t(x_i) = \frac{\exp(x_i^T \beta)}{1 + \exp(x_i^T \beta)}\). Or \(h_t\)
can just be linear regression: \(h_t(x_i) = x_i^T \beta\)

<li>\(\epsilon_t\) is the expectation of error with respect to the distribution of \(D_t\)</li>
<li>the intuition of \(\alpha_t\) is trying to make \(h_t\) more different than \(h_{t+1}\). We want the new weight \(D_{t+1}\)

\min \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N D_t(i)\left( y_i - x_i^T \beta \right)^2 
\end{aligned}
\]
So after solving weighted least square, we got 
\[
h_t(x) = X(X'W_tX)^{-1}X'W_tY
\]
where \(W_t\) is a \(N \times N\) diagonal matrix with \((W_t)_{ii} = D_t(i)\). Also if we are facing logistic regression,
the weights can be carried to each example by:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\log\text{likelihood} & = \sum_{i=1}^N \log P(y_i | x_i)^{D_t(i)} \\
& = \sum_{i=1}^N \log \left( y_iD_t(i)\left(\frac{1}{1+\exp(-x_i^T \beta)}\right) + (1-y_i)D_t(i) \left(\frac{1}{1+\exp(x_i^T \beta)}\right) \right)

</div>


<div class='tab-pane' id='optimization-of-adaboost'>
<h3>Optimization of AdaBoost</h3>

<h4>Objective</h4>

<p>Let us go back to adative boosting a little. Recall that every iteration time \(t\), we are updating the weight to be:
\[ D_{t+1}(i)  = \left\{
  \begin{array}{l l}
    D_t(i)\alpha_t^{-\frac{1}{2}} & \quad \text{if $h_t(x_i) = y_i$} \\
    D_t(i)\alpha_t^{\frac{1}{2}} & \quad \text{if $h_t(x_i) \ne y_i$} 
  \end{array} \right.\]
Where \(\alpha = \frac{1-\epsilon_t}{\epsilon_t}\). We can rewrite this to be:
\[
\begin{aligned}
D_{t+1}(i) & = D_t(i) \left[ \alpha_t^{\frac{1}{2}} \right]^{-y_ih_t(x_i)} \\
& = D_t(i) \cdot \exp \left( \frac{1}{2} \log \alpha_t (-y_ih_t(x_i))\right) \\
& = D_1(i) \prod_{t=1}^T \exp \left( - \frac{1}{2} y_i h_t(x_i) \log \alpha_t \right) \\
& = \frac{1}{N} \exp \left( -\frac{1}{2} y_i \sum_{t=1}^T h_t(x_i) \log \alpha_t \right)
\end{aligned}
\]
Again, recall in the adaboost decision tree, the final output hypothesis:
\[
h_f(x_i) = \text{sign} \left( \frac{1}{2} \sum_{t=1}^T h_t(x_i) \log \alpha_t \right)
\]
We call \(\sum_{t=1}^T\frac{1}{2}h_t(x_i)\log\alpha_t\) the <strong>voting score</strong> of \(h_t(x_i)\). And this voting score is
very similar to the functional margins in the SVM algorithm. 
\[
\begin{aligned}
y_i (\text{voting score}) & = y_i \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{1}{2} \log \alpha_t \cdot h_t(x_i) = y_i \omega_t^T\phi(x_i) \\
\text{SVM functional margins} & = y_i(\omega^Tx_i + b)
\end{aligned}
\]
where the \(\frac{1}{2} \log \alpha_t\) can be understood as the weight, and \(h_t(x_i)\) is nothing but a transformation
of original \(x_i\) to a new attribute. So the \(y_i(\text{voting score})\) is jiust a <strong>signed and unnormalized margin</strong>.
Now it is not hard for us to review the output from adaboost, \(h_f(x_i)\) is actually result based on a margin with sign.
The sign decides the final prediction of class, and the magnitude of the margin gives a level of confidence regards to
the prediction of class. So like in SVM, we would like to make the \(y_i \text{(voting score)}\) to be positive and as 
large as possible.
\[
\begin{aligned}
&y_i \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{1}{2} \log \alpha_t \cdot h_t(x_i) \;\; \text{positive and large} \\
\iff &\exp\left( - \frac{1}{2} y_i \sum_{t=1}^T h_t(x_i)\log\alpha_t\right) \;\; \text{is small} \\
\iff & D_{T+1}(i) \;\; \text{is small} \\
\iff & \text{AdaBoost decrease} \;\; \sum_{i=1}^ND_{t}(i)
\end{aligned}
\]
So AdaBoost decreases \(\sum_{i=1}^ND_{t}(i)\) and thus somewhat minimizes the final weight
\[
\sum_{i=1}^N D_{T+1}(i) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \exp \left( -\frac{1}{2} y_i \sum_{t=1}^T h_t(x_i) \log \alpha_t \right)
\]
Since we are trying to minimize the above function of <strong>objective</strong>, we can treat this final summation of weights as
an error function of adaboost with respect ot \(y_i\) and score \(s = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{t=1}^T h_t(x_i) \log \alpha_t\)
which is a exponential function.
\[
\textbf{Objective:} \;\;\;\; \text{error}_{\text{ADA}}(s, y) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \exp (- y_is_i)
\] 
So far, we have reformate the original adaboost algorithm to be a form of function of objective. Once we have an objective, 
we can consider optimization method to solve the objective. The first and the most popular computational method to solve
minimization problem is the <strong>Gradient Descent</strong>. </p>

<h4>Gradient descent</h4>

<p>Recall, gradient descent, at iteration \(t\) we update the parameter along a direction with a specific
amount such that the objective is minimized. Then we also can rewrite function of objective using
Taylor expansion with only first derivative:
\[
\min \text{MeanError} = \text{MeanError}(\omega_t + \gamma v) \approx \text{MeanError}(\omega_t) + \gamma v^T\nabla\text{MeanError}(\omega_t)
\]
Here \(\text{MeanError}()\) can be any predefined error measure function. Assume \(\omega\) is the parameter
vector in the error measure function to which we are going to minimize with respect. 
\(\nabla\text{MeanError}(\omega_t)\) is the gradient of the error function, which is also a vector. 
\(v^T\nabla\text{MeanError}(\omega_t)\) is the direction we choose to minimize the error function. For 
example, in coordinate ascent/descent method, \(v\) is one of the natural basis of 
\(\mathbb{R}^d\), if \(x_i \in \mathbb{R}^b\), like \((-1,0,\cdots, 0), \cdots, (0, \cdots, 0, -1)\). So 
coordinate ascent/descent update one natural basis direction at a time. However, in gradient 
ascent/descent method, \(v = (-1,-1,\cdots, -1)\), which means we update the objective respect to all
direction of \(\nabla\text{MeanError}(\omega_t)\) at same time.</p>

<p>Similar thing can be found in optimization version of adaboost. Before we start, we need some preliminary
understanding of gradient. In gradient descent, we are trying to find a vector related to the gradient of
objective \(\nabla E_{rror}\). Actually, a vector is very similar to a function. A vector can be treated as
a function of index. So finding a vector of direction can be understood as finding a function of direction
to minimize the function of objective.</p>

<p>So optimization task of adaboost can be shown as, at iteration \(T\):
\[
\begin{aligned}
\min_{h} E_{\text{ADA}} & = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \exp \left( -\frac{1}{2} y_i \left( \sum_{t=1}^{T-1} h_t(x_i) \log \alpha_t + \gamma h(x_i) \right) \right) \\
& = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{N} \exp \left( - \frac{1}{2} y_i  \sum_{t=1}^{T-1} h_t(x_i) \log \alpha_t \right) \cdot \exp \left( - y_i \gamma h_(x_i) \right) \\
& = \sum_{i=1}^N D_T(i) \cdot \exp\left( - y_i \gamma h(x_i) \right) \\
& \stackrel{taylor}{\approx} \sum_{i=1}^N D_{T}(i) \cdot \left( 1 - y_i \gamma h(x_i) \right) \\
& = \sum_{i=1}^N D_T(i) - \gamma \sum_{i=1}^N D_T(i) \cdot y_i h(x_i)
\end{aligned}
\]
The first term is fixed, so we are trying to find a good \(h(x_i)\) to minimize 
\(\sum_{i=1}^N D_T(i) \cdot y_i h(x_i)\) if we assume the step length \(\gamma\) is given.
\[
\text{Find good} \;\; h(\text{function direction}) \iff \text{minimize} \sum_{i=1}^N D_T(i) \cdot y_i h(x_i)
\]
For binary classification, where \(y_i\) and \(h(x_i)\) both \(\in \{-1, +1 \}\)
\[ \sum_{i=1}^N D_T(i) (-y_ih(x_i)) = \sum_{i=1}^N D_T(i) \cdot \left\{
\begin{array}{l l}
  -1 & \quad \text{if $h(x_i) = y_i$} \\
  +1 & \quad \text{if $h(x_i) \ne y_i$} 
\end{array} \right.\]</p>

<p>\[ \iff \sum_{i=1}^N D_T(i) (-y_ih(x_i)) = -\sum_{i=1}^N D_T(i) + \sum_{i=1}^N D_T(i) \cdot \left\{
\begin{array}{l l}
  0 & \quad \text{if $h(x_i) = y_i$} \\
  2 & \quad \text{if $h(x_i) \ne y_i$} 
\end{array} \right.\]</p>

<p>\[
\begin{aligned}
\iff \sum_{i=1}^N D_T(i) (-y_ih(x_i)) & = -\sum_{i=1}^N D_T(i) + 2 \cdot \sum_{i:h(x_i) \ne y_i} D_T(i) \\
& = -\sum_{i=1}^N D_T(i) + 2 \epsilon_{T} \cdot \sum_{i=1}^N D_T(i)
\end{aligned}
\]
Where \(\sum_{i=1}^N D_T(i)\) is known. Who minimizes \(\epsilon_T\)? It is the <strong>WeakLearner</strong> in
step 2 of AdaBoost! So in the step 2 of AdaBoost, we were trying to train the <strong>WeakLearner</strong>
and find a \(h_t\) which is actually the best function direction from the gradient descent view.</p>

<h4>Steepest descent</h4>

<p>AdaBoost finds \(h_t\) by minimized \(E_{\text{ADA}}\) with respect to function direction \(h_t\).
After finding \(h_t\), we also can minimize \(E_{\text{ADA}}\) with respect to \(\gamma\), the step
length.</p>

<p>\[ E_{\text{ADA}} = \sum_{i=1}^N D_T(i) \cdot \left\{
\begin{array}{l l}
  \exp(- \gamma) & \quad \text{if $h(x_i) = y_i$} \\
  \exp(+ \gamma) & \quad \text{if $h(x_i) \ne y_i$} 
\end{array} \right.\]</p>

<p>\[
\begin{aligned}
\iff E_{\text{ADA}} & = \sum_{i=1}^N D_T(i) \cdot \left( (\text{# of correct}) \exp(-\gamma) + (\text{# of incorrect}) \exp(+\gamma)\right) \\
& = \sum_{i=1}^N D_T(i) \cdot \left( (1 - \epsilon_T) \exp(-\gamma) + \epsilon_T \exp(+\gamma)\right)
\end{aligned}
\]
Right now since everything is known except \(\gamma\), we can find the optimization of 
\(E_{\text{ADA}}\) by solving \(\frac{\partial E_{\text{ADA}}}{\partial \gamma} = 0\). Then we found:
\[
\text{steepest} \; \gamma_t = \frac{1}{2} \log \frac{1 - \epsilon_t}{\epsilon_t} = \frac{1}{2} \log \alpha_t
\]
In summary, Adaboost is <strong>steepest descent with approximate functional descent</strong>. Approximate 
here is because we used taylor expansion.</p>
